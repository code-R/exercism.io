        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>Hootcode is still a prototype, and we are always experimenting with the basic feature set. The goal is to develop a V1 of the product from scratch using everything that we've learned building and using the prototype.</p>
        <p>The V1 will be built using well-known frameworks and conventions to minimize the barrier to contributing.</p>
