        <h1>Introducing the Command Line Client</h1>
        <p>Hootcode is all about having conversations about code. In order to start having those conversations, you need to install the hootcode command line client. The hootcode command line client is the all-in-one tool for fetching and submitting code. Let's get started.</p>

        <h2>Start a conversation with your code</h2>

        <p>Software development is an activity that should not be performed in isolation.  Hootcode is intended to help you interact with other developers by way of your software code.</p>
        <p>Hootcode provides a launching point for this to occur.  Here's how it works:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>You fetch some challenges in the form of README documents.  These include associated test suites</li>
          <li>Then write code in order to make the tests pass</li>
          <li>Submit the code and begin the conversation with others</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>By repeating this process you will:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>Share while discussing how YOU solved the problem</li>
          <li>Learn from others as you discover how they solved the same problem</li>
          <li>Gain experience through repeated practice solving problems</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Don't be shy - start right now</h3>

        <p>Begin by installing the <code>hootcode</code> CLI (<em>Command-Line Interface</em>) tool.  <a href="/installing-cli" target="_blank" title="Installing the Hootcode CLI">Details here</a></p>

        <p>With the CLI installed, configure it using the <code>configure</code> command. You can always find your API key on your <a href="/account">account page</a>.

        <% if !current_user.guest? %>
          <pre><code>  hootcode configure --key=<%= current_user.key%> --host=http://hootcode.com --api=http://54.172.126.241</code></pre>

          <p>The command can take an optional <code>--dir</code> argument, if you want to specify a particular directory. If nothing is specified, a directory will be created for you in your home directory.</p>
          <% else %>
          <p class="alert alert-danger"> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Please login to get your api key</p>
        <% end %>

        <p>Fetch problems with this simple command:<br />

      <pre><code>  hootcode fetch</code></pre>
